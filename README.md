<p align="center">Programming languages saying that they suck</p>
<br></br>
This is a repository where we post programming languages saying that they sucks.

This was created to ironize programming language hate. I got tired of people saying:
"Python sucks", or "Rust is for femboys!" or even "Java is useless".

This is a disrespect to all the mantainers that work on them, and I think you are free to code in whatever
lang you want.
